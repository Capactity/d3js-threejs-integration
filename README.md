**Sphere-collision**
-------

A sphere collision implemented like collision detection example from [mbostockâ€™s block #3231298](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298) . In D3 2D implemention d3.layout.force layout and [d3.geom.quadtree](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Quadtree-Geom) is used. Recently I found a D3 plugin extending d3.layout.force to the third dimension as [d3.layout.force3D](https://github.com/ggeoffrey/d3.layout.force3D) , this plugin has *d3.geom.octree* for the 3D data.
